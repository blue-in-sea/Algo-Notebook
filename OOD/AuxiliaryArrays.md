An **auxiliary array** is a temporary array used in algorithms to assist in solving problems more efficiently. It is often employed 
to store intermediate results, keep track of certain information, or simplify complex operations. 

The use of an auxiliary array can improve time or space complexity, depending on the problem.

### Common Use Cases of Auxiliary Arrays:
##### Sorting Algorithms:
* In merge sort, an auxiliary array is used to merge two sorted subarrays.
* In counting sort, an auxiliary array is used to store the count of elements.

##### Dynamic Programming:
* In problems like the longest increasing subsequence (LIS), an auxiliary array can store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.

##### Tracking Information:
* In problems requiring frequency counting or prefix sums, an auxiliary array can store cumulative data.

##### Matrix Operations:
* In matrix transposition or rotation, an auxiliary array can help store intermediate values.

##### String Manipulation:
* In problems like finding the longest palindrome or substring, an auxiliary array can store character frequencies or other metadata.
